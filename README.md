# Path2eSpellNethys
A program that uses NethysAPI to display Pathfinder2e Sepll info

This code uses the axios library to make a GET request to the Nethys API endpoint, retrieves a list of spells from the API, and then displays the names of the spells in an HTML ul element with the ID spell-list.

This project is based off my other repository where I practicved using Fetch to get info. That project obtained ancestry info from api.pathfinder2.fr while this project uses the nethys api for spell list.

TODO
integrate html and css display
allow for more data types
